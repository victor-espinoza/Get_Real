Project Overview:

This is a simple text-based C++ program that performs various functions on complex numbers. 

This program is very simple. With it you can create complex numbers, change complex number values, print out a complex number, multiply complex numbers together, determine the absolute value of a complex number, and check a complex number for equality with another complex number.

Dependencies:
Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop Version: 11.0.61030.00 Update 4.

Sample Output:
Welcome to the GetReal program; lets get started!

complex2.toString() Output:
5-12i

complex1.toString() Output:
4-12i

complex1.getReal() Output:
4

complex1.getImaginary() Output:
-12

complex2.absoluteValue() Output:
13

complex1.multiply(complex2) Output:
-124-108i

That concludes this program; thank you for using it!
Enjoy the rest of your day!
